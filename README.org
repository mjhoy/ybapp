* ybapp

A little application to parse an xlsx file and download any linked
files therein.

** Development

To build ~ybapp~:

*** using ~stack~ (easy)

1. [[https://github.com/commercialhaskell/stack#how-to-install][Install stack]]
2. Clone the respository and build with stack:
   #+BEGIN_SRC sh
     git clone https://github.com/mjhoy/ybapp.git
     cd ybapp
     stack setup
     stack build
     # executable now installed in ...
   #+END_SRC

*** using ~nix~

(assuming you've got a working nix install), all you should need to do
is run ~nix-shell~ in the repository to set up a build environment,
and then the normal cabal commands:

#+BEGIN_SRC sh
  cd ybapp
  nix-shell
  cabal configure
  cabal build
  # should produce executable in dist/
#+END_SRC
