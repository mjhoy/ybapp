Double-click `ybapp.command' to open the YellowBarn application
downloader.

You will be asked to select an excel file, and a folder for
download. Simply drag these onto the terminal window that appears and
then press RETURN to select them.

If you do not select a download folder and simply press RETURN, a folder
will be created on your desktop called "ybapp_downloads" where
downloaded files will be put.

If at any time you need to stop or quit the program, press
Control-c. You may then quit the Terminal application.
